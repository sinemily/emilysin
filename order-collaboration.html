      <h3>Order Collaboration</h3>
      <h4>Impact & results</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Adopted by existing customers</li>
        <li>Generated 5 new sales leads at the Gartner supply chain conference</li>
        <li>Key feature in signing a new customer</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p>Most of the time, brands negotiate with their supplier on orders through emails or over the phone. As you can imagine, this gets messy when they start to handle multiple Purchase Orders, each with several to hundreds of line items requested. A lot of time is wasted sifting through decentralized information that could be spent scheduling work or addressing issues on the production floor. That’s why Nulogy wanted to build Order Collaboration.</p>
      <h4 class="expand">+ more context</h4>
      <p>Most of the everyday products we own started out the same way - they originated from a Purchase Order. A purchase order is commercial document issued by a buyer to a seller indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services. Usually, the buyer is a brand with its own line of products or services. For example, the brand that makes your favourite shampoo that’s currently sitting in your shower caddy. The seller is also known as the supplier. The supplier is responsible for manufacturing and fulfilling the order to the specifications detailed in the purchase order.</p>
      <p>The brand and supplier need to agree on the exact products and the quantity and price for each product requested. There can be multiple products requested on a single purchase order. You can think of each unique combination of product code, quantity and unit price on the purchase order as a Line Item.</p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Order Collaboration removes the reliance on manual tracking and updating of Purchase Order information over disjointed documents and spreadsheets by allowing brands and suppliers to collaborate on one platform.</p>
      <h5>Surface the most urgent information first</h5>
      <p>The table is by default sorted by status, so planners can focus on the Purchase Orders that require the most immediate action first.</p>
