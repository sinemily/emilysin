      <h3>Company Story</h3>
      <p class="end">This is the story of how I worked with a multi-billion dollar global manufacturing and marketing company for household, personal care and specialty products to deliver 3 key features in the span of three months.</p>

      <h4>About the company</h4>
      <p class="middle">They are a leading CPG (consumer packaged goods) company best known for its 11 major brands in the household and personal care space. They have grown volume faster than other major players in the personal care space in the last four years.</p>

        <h4 class="trigger">- less about the company</h4>
      </a>
      <p class="show-hide end" hidden>They have ambitious growth plans, including expanding in international markets and acquiring new brands. They anticipate outsourcing more production to co-manufacturers; therefore, enabling collaboration and visibility across their network is a key strategic initiative for them and one of the CEO’s top priority initiatives.</p>
      <h4>Project Significance</h4>
      <p class="end">Having a platform for collaboration with suppliers is a key priority for the CEO. They are focused on the success of this project and we have all their attention. They have 90 co-manufacturers in their network, many of whom don’t have systems to connect and collaborate with this company. This is a community that represents a huge market opportunity for our solution.</p>
      <h4>The goal</h4>
      <p class="middle">Within the first 3 months  of the project (October to December 2019) the goal was to connect 12 of their suppliers to the platform to enable visibility into supplier data, and have both brand and supplier using the existing features, as well as three new features yet to be developed:</p>

      <h4>Results</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Successfully onboarded 12 suppliers by the end of 2019</li>
        <li>Unlocked trust with our stakeholders, allowing me to run user testing and shadow their planners</li>
        <li>Continued partnership with the company</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>My role</h4>
      <p class="end">I was the sole designer on the product team comprised of 6 developers, 1 agile tester and 1 product manager. I was responsible for designing Production Tracking, Materials Overview, and Scorecards in time for development and release by the end of December 2019.</p>
      <h4>Notable elements of this project</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>3 months to design and develop 3 key features</li>
        <li>Weekly validation with our main stakeholders and super users of the system</li>
        <li>Without trust in Nulogy built through an established track record of delivery, user testing was not possible within the first three months</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <h4 id="production-tracking">Production Tracking</h4>
      <p class="middle">Production Tracking gives brands visibility into the day to day production of their suppliers. With this visibility, brands can better track the progress of their orders and troubleshoot issues immediately as they arise.</p>
      <h5 class="showcase-beginning">Surface the most urgent information first</h5>
      <p class="middle showcase">The table is by default sorted to surface the highest priority statuses first, so planners can identify the Purchase Order Line Items that require the most immediate action.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/poli-table.png" alt="Line Item Table" />
      <h5 class="showcase">Provide visibility at the right level</h5>
      <p class="middle showcase">Visibility into daily production records can be viewed on each Purchase Order Line Item.</p>

      <h4 id="materials-overview">Materials Overview</h4>
      <p class="middle">Materials Overview gives brands visibility into where their material is located across their network, how much inventory is present, and helps brands reduce waste by surfacing which materials are at risk of expiry.</p>
      <h5 class="showcase-beginning">Optimize for action</h5>
      <p class="middle showcase">At Risk, Expired and Good inventory is surfaced immediately, to allow users to act on the inventory as needed.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/materials-summary.png" alt="Materials Overview Summary" />
      <h5 class="showcase">Build flexibility into viewing information</h5>
      <p class="middle showcase">Users can filter to see inventory they care about, even down to the individual Item level.</p>
      <img class="solution-end" src="assets/images/materials-filter.png" alt="Filtering on Materials Overview" />
      <h5 class="showcase-beginning">Provide appropriate detail</h5>

      <img class="solution-end" src="assets/images/materials-details.png" alt="Details on Inventory" />

      <h4 id="scorecards">Scorecards</h4>
      <p class="middle">Materials Overview gives brands visibility into where their material is located across their network, how much inventory is present, and helps brands reduce waste by surfacing which materials are at risk of expiry.</p>
      <h5 class="showcase-beginning">Maximize visibility with real-time monitoring</h5>
      <p class="middle showcase">Brands are able to track Inventory Levels, Weekly Schedule Attainment, Finished Goods Produced, and troubleshoot Attainment Issues. The graphs show the current date by default, so brands can track real-time performance.</p>

      </div>

      <h4>Approach</h4>
      <h5>Build a shared understanding by collaborating early in the process</h5>
      <p class="middle">One of the first things we did was run an <a href="https://medium.com/@springdo/a-facilitators-recipe-for-event-storming-941dcb38db0d" target="blank">example mapping</a>
        session with the team. This created early team-wide alignment and the multidisciplinary perspective allowed us to identify behaviours and use cases that if missed, would have led to re-work further into the design process.</p>
      <h5>Validate quickly, and early on</h5>
      <p class="end">I spent two weeks with a design co-op sketching out our ideas and validating them with former Brand Planners that now worked at our company. We spent several hours each day together sorting out the workflow and bouncing ideas off each other. At the end of the two weeks, we showed them our sketches and made adjustments based on the feedback.</p>

      <h4>Phase 1: Define</h4>
      <h5>Who are the key players and what are they trying to accomplish?</h5>
      <p class="middle">I interviewed 3 planners on the brand side, and 5 customer service representatives (CSRs) from the supplier side. They were each asked similar questions, with two versions of the script for either the brand or supplier perspective.</p>
      <a class="expand">

      </a>
      <ol class="show-hide questions" hidden>
        <li>Can you describe how you spend a typical day or week?</li>
        <li>Which activities do you spend the most time on?</li>
        <li>What is/are your worst pain point(s)?</li>
        <li>What kind of reports or documentation do you work with to negotiate on orders with your customers?</li>
        <li>Who do you usually communicate with on the customer side? What input do you need from them to either generate or modify the documentation?</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="end">Using responses from the interviews, I generated personas by narrowing down the findings into three categories using the
        <a href="https://designabetterbusiness.com/2017/10/12/how-to-really-understand-your-customer-with-the-value-proposition-canvas/" target="blank">job-to-be-done, pains, and gains</a> value proposition.</p>

        <img src="assets/images/supplier-persona.svg" alt="Supplier CSR Persona" />
      </div>
      <h5>How can we help our users accomplish their goals?</h5>
      <p class="middle">After defining the brand and supplier personas, I created a workflow to capture how both supplier and brand would collaborate together.</p>
      <img class="workflow mobile" src="assets/images/mobile-workflow.png" alt="Workflow" />
      <img class="workflow desktop" src="assets/images/desktop-workflow.png" alt="Workflow" />

      <h4>Phase 2: Ideate</h4>
      <h5>Information Density</h5>
      <p class="middle">When we ran our initial validation with the paper prototypes, we experimented with Purchase Order details in a modal and in a slide out side panel.</p>
      <div class="sketch1">
        <img class="pic1" src="assets/images/paper-modal.png" alt="Modal Sketch" />
        <img class="pic1" src="assets/images/paper-side-panel.png" alt="Side Panel Sketch" />
      </div>
        <p class="pic2 middle">However, our requirements changed partway through the design process – users needed to specify multiple line items on a Purchase Order, instead of just one. I opted to move the information to a new page, to allow for more real estate to manage this information.</p>
        <img class="pic2" src="assets/images/paper-new-page.png" alt="Full Page Sketch" />
      <h5>Actionable Language</h5>
      <div class="sketch3">
        <p class="pic3 middle">Capturing the status of a Purchase Order was key for users to understand which party needed to action on a Purchase Order. We initially approached the naming of statuses from by describing the actions taken on the Purchase Order, using terms like “modified by supplier” and “modified by brand”.</p>
        <img class="pic3" src="assets/images/paper-statuses.png" alt="Statuses Sketch" />
      </div>
      <p class="end">However, after validation with the Brand Planners, we discovered the naming was not resonating with them. Planners have an endless to-do list and are therefore constantly under pressure to ensure deadlines are met. The passive language used did not convey urgency to act on the Purchase Orders. We refined the language to encourage action and rather tell the planners what needed to be done. We settled on the following statuses listed in order of highest priority first: Requires Response, Pending Response, Accepted, Canceled.</p>

      <h4>Phase 3: Prototype and Test</h4>
      <h5>Task Walkthrough</h5>
      <p class="middle">To test the overall usability with suppliers, I designed a task walkthrough that simulated the supplier receiving a Purchase Order from the brand, and asked the supplier to complete a series of tasks to successfully respond to the Purchase Order. One of the most notable findings occurred in 80% of the tests. The suppliers would immediately go to reject the Purchase Order, instead of responding to the Purchase Order and making proposals.</p>
      <a class="expand">

      </a>
      <ol class="show-hide questions" hidden>
        <li>You have just logged in to GO, and you see that you have some Purchase Orders that require your attention. Please navigate to the first one in the table.</li>
        <li>Can you describe to me what you are currently looking at?</li>
        <li>Now that you’ve had some time to look over the line items, you’ve decided you want to make some proposals to two line items. How would you do that?</li>
        <li>For 6734 Aspirin Family Pack, you want to propose $1.50 instead of $2.00, and Feb 18, 2019 at the same time of day.</li>
        <li>Now indicate a reason and add a change note to the line item.</li>
        <li>For 7734 Aspirin Family Pack, you want to take the 3 day buffer - please propose a later date, then indicate a reason and add a change note to the item.</li>
        <li>Let’s share those changes with the customer now.</li>
        <li>What does it look like has happened since you’ve shared those changes?</li>
        <li>Let’s now accept the last two items that require response.</li>
        <li>Is everything looking as expected?</li>
        <li>Let’s say for example, that we made proposals for 6734 Aspirin Family Pack but we’ve changed our minds and want to accept it. How would you do that?</li>
        <li>For this example, let’s cancel these changes.</li>
        <li>Now, let’s say the customer has now responded to the Purchase Order. The screen on the next page will simulate a response to the Purchase Order from the customer. Click anywhere to proceed.</li>
        <li>What do think are the changes that have occurred?</li>
        <li>And if you were to respond to the line item and make a different proposal, where would you click?</li>
      </ol>
      <img class="wireframes" src="assets/images/supplier-reject-test.png" alt="Reject Button User Test" />
      <p class="middle">From the testing, I found 3 major takeaways:</p>
      <h5>1 - Blanket “Reject” button was drawing too much attention</h5>
      <p class="middle">One of the most notable findings occurred in 80% of the tests. The suppliers would immediately go to reject the Purchase Order, instead of responding to the Purchase Order and making proposals. Upon further investigation, I discovered that suppliers will almost never reject a Purchase Order, instead working with the Brand to agree on terms. I removed the reject button in later tests and noticed that the success rate for the suppliers to find and make proposals jumped to 100%.</p>
      <h5>2 - Planners and CSRs are responding to line items on an individual basis</h5>
      <p class="middle">I had initially designed the feature to have a "Make proposals" button that would make the whole line item table editable, under the assumption that the planners are likely to quickly make changes to each line item if they are making proposals. During testing, it became obvious that the users were distracted by the visual noise that was created in the table when all of the fields suddenly became editable. I dug into this a bit more during testing and learned that users are often reading the content for each line item, and then deciding whether or not to make changes to the proposal or accept the line item. With the visual noise on the table in “edit” mode, they were not able to decipher the information as easily. I opted to have the option to make proposals on a single line item, available as a row-level action in the table, with the edits happening in a side panel. So when users needed to make changes, they could still read the information in the table without being obstructed by unnecessary input fields.
      </p>
      <h5>3 - Having the ability to accept the entire Purchase Order and accept individual line items should be handled consistently</h5>
      <p class="middle">In the design I tested, users were able to accept the entire Purchase Order through the “Accept Purchase Order” button. They also had the option once they clicked “Make Proposals” to accept line items individually or in bulk. With this design there was a lot of confusion around what accepting the entire Purchase Order meant versus using bulk accept on the line items. Introducing two different ways to achieve the same outcome was not making it easier or more efficient for users to accomplish what they needed, but rather complicating the interaction on the page. I modified the design to always expose the checkboxes and allowing the user to accept individually on the row-level, as well as in bulk by using the select all checkbox. By removing the extra “Accept Purchase Order” button, users are able to still accept the entire Purchase Order, and the confusion of two pathways to the same outcome was removed.</p>
      <p class="middle">Here's what the revised designs looked like:</p>
